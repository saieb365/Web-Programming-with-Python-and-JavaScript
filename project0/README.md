# Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Project 0

This is the first website Project in the **Web Programming with Python and JavaScript** course. The objectives of this Project for the students are to become comfortable with _HTML_ and _CSS_ to design and style web-pages. The Website is built/designed in _HTML5_ and styled with _CSS3_, _SCSS_, _Bootstrap_ components, and Media Queries. The Project contains 4 web-pages each using different HTML components/tags to illustrate how each components would be utilized in a real business website.

The Project is comprised of 4 web-pages as follows:
- **index.html**; The main page of the website, utilizing several _html_ tags such as `div` element, `forms`, `tables`, `ordered` and `unordered lists`, and etc. This page and all the pages in the Project are styled with different `CSS` selectors, `SCSS`, and Media Queries.
- **image.html**; Another simple webpage which has an image and links to other web-pages on the website.
- **articles.html**; This web-page contains several *HTML* elements such as `div` (division), `p` (paragraph), `a` (anchor), `ul` (un-ordered list), and etc. so that it could be styled with complex _CSS_ styling such as media responsive design elements.
-**messages.html**; A webpage specifically designed to utilize _SCSS_ inheritance feature.

### Some of the features of the Website:
- You can navigate back and forth in pages on my website through navigation links located under the main heading on each page.
- The website uses different _CSS_ properties and selectors; such as `h`, `div`, `p`, `container`, `id`, `class`, and etc.
 - The website also uses mobile responsive `@medai` query such that the styling or content of the page would changes when the size of the screen changes.
 - The website uses Bootstrap component and columns for layout purposes using Bootstrapâ€™s grid model.
 -The website also uses SCSS variables, SCSS nesting, and SCSS inheritance.

Though it is not a real world website and it does not contain useful contents, but I think it is quite compliant with the requirements of the Project rubrics.
